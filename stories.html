      <h2><span>Akhona</span> Cekiso</h2>
      <p>“My journey at the University of Johannesburg has been nothing short of transformative. I am genuinely grateful to have been a UJ student. UJ provided me with more than just academic knowledge, it offered financial, mental, and emotional support that shaped my entire varsity experience.
At the beginning of my studies, I was supported by NSFAS, but in my final year, I was fortunate to receive the EMAT Bursary. That bursary didn’t just ease my academic journey, it elevated it. Everything was covered: tuition, registration, accommodation, meals, even mental wellness programmes. I could go from writing an exam straight to a nourishing meal. That kind of support gives you the peace of mind to focus on succeeding.
In my final year, I was balancing 7 modules in the first semester and 6 in the second. Because I wasn’t worried about fees or food, I could give my full attention to my studies. I also had access to a supportive scholarship network, including mentors and even our scholarship directors, real people who were always available and genuinely invested in our success.
Resilience became my guide. Even when things didn’t go as planned like not being able to finish my Honours due to project availability, I stayed true to myself and kept pushing forward. Today, I’m working at Aspen in my first job in the industry, and I know it was this funding that opened the door.
To my funders, thank you. You didn’t make a mistake in choosing me. Your bursary didn’t just help a student; it helped launch a life. Your investment will ripple forward in every step of my professional journey.”

     <h2><span>Brilliant Thakgalo </span> Theko</h2>
      <p>“My journey at the University of Johannesburg has been one of growth, resilience, and determination. I pursued my studies in Industrial Engineering and ultimately obtained my Honors degree. My first year came with its challenges. I failed two modules, which at the time felt like a major setback. However, instead of letting that discourage me, it became the fuel that pushed me to work harder, manage my time better, and truly commit to my academic goals.

Over the years, I not only improved academically but also developed problem-solving, analytical, and leadership skills that have shaped the engineer I am today. Completing my Honors was a proud moment, not just because of the qualification, but because of the perseverance and growth it represents.

At the time of my study at UJ, my mother was unemployed, and honestly, I didn’t even know how I was going to register. It was one of the most uncertain and stressful moments of my life. Receiving partial funding was a lifeline. It meant I could continue with my studies without the constant fear of being excluded due to finances.
Academically, it allowed me to focus on my coursework and push myself harder instead of being distracted by financial worries. Personally, it gave me a sense of hope and reassurance that I wasn’t alone in my journey. Knowing that someone believed in my potential enough to invest in me motivated me to make the most of the opportunity, which is why I worked even harder and eventually achieved my Honors in Industrial Engineering.

Receiving this kind of support means more than just financial assistance. It represents belief, opportunity, and hope. It showed me that even in my toughest moments, when I didn’t know how I would continue, there were people and systems willing to stand behind my dreams. It reminded me that my goals were worth pursuing, even when circumstances seemed against me.
On a personal level, it has taught me the value of resilience, gratitude, and giving back. I carry this experience as a constant reminder that when we are supported, we are not only able to achieve our own goals but also inspire and open doors for others.”

     <h2><span>Vukona Gavin </span>Mbhalati</h2>
      <p>“My academic journey at the University of Johannesburg began in 2021 when I enrolled for the Diploma in Food and Beverage Operations. After completing it in 2023, I went on to pursue the Advanced Diploma in Hospitality Management in 2024. However, during this time, I found myself facing a serious financial hurdle. I still owed R10,000 after receiving partial funding from the CBE.
Despite applying for general bursaries with little success, I was fortunate to be selected for the Optimi Bursary, which covered the remaining balance. This made all the difference, I could finally access my results, graduate, and receive my certificate. That certificate became my ticket to actively job-hunt and apply for opportunities with confidence. More importantly, I was able to register for my Honours degree, which I am currently pursuing.
This financial relief lifted a heavy burden from me and my family. My parents were deeply concerned, not understanding why I was still studying without funding. Even though I had no concrete solution at the time, I reassured them to keep their minds at ease. I remained hopeful, believing that things would work out, and they did.
To the funders who made this possible, I extend my heartfelt gratitude. Your support didn’t just help me financially; it helped me move forward with dignity. I urge you to continue doing the same for others, especially for those who are less privileged and yet determined to succeed. Your help changes lives.”

     <h2><span>MJ </span>Mvelase</h2>
      <p>"I happen to be a lecturer at the University of Johannesburg. When we teach students, we are confronted with their real suffering. I also help them privately. When UJ gave us the opportunity to help students, I grabbed it with both hands. When I was a student, there was real suffering and unfortunately there were no initiatives to help the students, so we were on our own. We can't turn a blind eye to the people we deal with daily. Yes, we don’t have much, but we can share a fraction of what we have, to brighten someone's day.
The positive effects are already noticeable now, but they will be even more noticeable in the future when the students we support have financial means. Perhaps they will then remember their difficult times and consider making a contribution as our alumni.
The Faculty of Science. I belong to the Faculty of Science, so I am most affected by what is happening here. 
Students are like my customers. They are the people I serve. It is very difficult to serve students who suffer because they cannot concentrate, not because they are incapable, but because they have no energy. They focus more on their problems.
I enjoy giving a small part of what I have but knowing that the impact will be enormous. It's important to pool resources and help where we can.
To the students that are benefiting from my support I want to say “stay focussed. Never give up. If you think it's hard, know that we've had it harder. Your ambition to succeed should be your driving force. Eventually you will make it in life.”
